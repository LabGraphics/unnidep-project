             <p>You are here because you are either a member or are looking to learn more about
             UNNIDEP. We say thank you for your interest in Our Organization. UNNIDEP was 
             establised in 2016 solely as a NONPOLITICAL, NOT FOR PROFIT Organization committed 
             to making a difference in lives of the citizen of Nimba County and Liberia at large.
             The need to help the women, children, and men of Nimba County is dire and help could
             not come soon enough. The challenges of our people are enormous, these challenges are 
             a matter life and death. Our people's access to basic food, education, and healthcare
             is far in between. </p>

         <p>One does not necessarily have to be a millionare, a celebrity, 
        or an athlete to make an impact in the lives of those that are 
        poor and desolate. All you need is the heart and the will to want to make a
        difference one individual or issue at a time. </p>
        <p> Mother Theresa once said " Not all of us can do great things but we 
        can do small things with great love". Those small things could be providing
        school supplies to a child that is desperately needing to learn but lacks 
        the bare necessities. Or renovating a dilapidated or makeshift school house
        that would give students an atmosphere conducive to learing.
        <p>We can not overstress the many challenges the men, women, and children of
        Nimba County are faced with, but also we just can not under stated the need for 
        us to lend a hand. Making a difference and improving lives one issue or individual
        at a time is our committment to the citizens of Nimba County and Liberia at large.
        Join us in our cause, become a member/partner or donate. </p>
